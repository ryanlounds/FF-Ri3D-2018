<h2> Ri3D Team Ontario 2.0 Robot Code</h2><br>
This repository contains the code for Ri3D Team Ontario (1337)'s code for the heavily revised robot.<br>
<h3>Deploying</h3><br>
The code for the robot uses pieces from Team 1310's Toronto Code Collective, so you'll need to install that library as well before trying to deploy.<br>
